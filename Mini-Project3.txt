Fall 2018 - A cold November evening.

I. GOAL
    The goal of this project is to utilize two different database
    types to accomplish the goal of logging app usage data.
    The two database varieties used will be "SQL" and "MongoDB"
    The database (which variety will depend on the tagged version
    checked out of GitHub) will be stored locally on the user's
    machine and will include a README detailing use.

    Either way, there will be a companion piece of software which
    will enable the user to view data and possibly visualize it.

II. DATA GATHERED
    The main software will be modified to gather data in two ways:
        1.  A list of user sessions, the channel, and the number of 
            images gathered.
        2.  A raw table with the words, the user session, and the
            image index.
    User sessions will be identified by a timestamp.

III. METHOD
    At start of session:
        session = current system time
    Get images (as normal)
    Add entry to the "sessions" table containing the session timestamp,
        the channel handle, and the number of images.
    For each image:
        get the words found (as normal)
            for each word:
                 Add an entry to the "descriptors" table with:
                    - session timestamp, image index, the word.

IV. DATA RETRIEVAL
    Data can be retrieved in a couple of ways:
        1. Number of images in a given session
        2. Number of sessions
        3. Number of channels accessed
        4. Most common descriptors

V. SQL TABLE STRUCTURE
	1. sessions
	id (real)	session (real)	channel (text)	images (real)
	2. descriptors
	id (real)	session (real)	image (real)	word (text)
